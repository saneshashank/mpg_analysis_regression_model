This article explores the relationship between mpg and other variables based on the mtcars data set present in R.The analysis answers the following questions based on regression model analysis: 

1. is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG.
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.

The conclusion reached on the basis of analysis below is that manual transmission is better for MPG and using our constructed model we have calculated 95% confidence interval for increase in mpg for change in manual to automatic transmission mode.
